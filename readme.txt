Description: 

quite nasty hexeditor in vb6
can handle files upto 2.1 gb (uses a custom filebuffer to avoid loading all data at once)
supports copy paste , 
delete / insert bytes
copy paste data in both hex/text mode, delete/insert bytes
custom scrollbar to allow more than 32k lines

i saw some other guy has submitted his hexeditor so i figure i could just as well 
submit mine to instead of letting it just rott on my hd...

its not finnished but its still quite nice , hope you like it.

 	This is a really nice hexeditor that I am going to transition into an OCX control
        for use in my projects. Thanks to the original author for his hard work and publishing
        the source on PSC.
